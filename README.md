# Timer

This simple timer app is focusing on practicing some basic JavaScript skills, particularly classes and functions.

## Getting Started

When a user visits application inside the browser. They are shown a number 30 in the timer, a play button and a pause button. Whenever the user clicks on play. We're then going to count this timer down.

As that timer is counting down, a user can pause it at any time by clicking on the pause button right there and then resume it by clicking on play again.


## Things The Program Does


- Displays Timer: First off, one of the core responsibilities of the program is to display the timer,displays some number of seconds, the play button underneath it and the pause button.

- Show an animated border around the timer: Every time the timer starts to tick down. We update the animated border.


## Implementation

- Event listener to watch for a click on 'start' button
- Draw a full border around the timer
- Start counting down the timer
- Each time the timer counts down, update the border
- Each time the timer counts down, update the text
- if we counted down and the timer reaches 0
- Reset the border 
- Reset internal timer to get ready for another run
